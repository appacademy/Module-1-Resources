  Closures

  What is a closure?
    * A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared.
    * A closure is when an inner function uses, or changes, variables in an outer function

  Basic closure rules
    * Closures have access to any variables within its own, as well as any outer function's, scope when they are declared.
    * A closure will keep reference to all the variables when it was defined even if the outer function has returned.

  Advantages of closures
    * private state
      ** data encapsulation
      ** security
    * currying

  Disadvantages to closures
    * Memory intensive - variables are not garbage collected because they are stored in the lexical environment

  Lexical environment
    * Anytime a function is defined a lexical environment is created
    * Lexical environments consist of all the variable defined and where they were defined

// Call Stack
// * The call stack is a structure that js uses to keep track of evaluation of function calls
// * function that is at the top of the stack is the function currently being executed
//   * first in last out
//   * last in first out
// * stack of plates
// * when a function is called - it gets pushed to the top
// * when a function is returned - it gets popped off the stack
//   * if a function does not have a return, it will still return and just to default its value to undefined

//   elephants.push(name);
