# Scope Project - Part 2

In this project, you will be using your knowledge of scope to solve programming
problems.

In this part, you will be tackling the next 6 problems:

- `06-closure-sandwiches`
- `07-set-time-out`
- `08-hidden-counter`
- `09-interrupter`
- `10-count-down`
- `11-lazy-adder`

Make sure to write your solutions using arrow function notation. Try to take
advantage of the properties of arrow functions and/or closures to solve these
problems if possible.

Don't forget to run the Mocha to test your solutions.
