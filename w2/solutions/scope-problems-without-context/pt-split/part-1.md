# Scope Project - Part 1

In this project, you will be using your knowledge of scope to solve programming
problems.

In this part, you will be tackling the first 6 problems:

- `00-arrow-addfive`
- `01-arrow-full-name`
- `02-arrow-my-map`
- `03-arrow-rest-sum`
- `04-arrow-average-value`
- `05-arrow-mirror-array`

You've probably seen some of these problems before. This time, try writing them
with arrow function notation. Try to take advantage of the properties of
arrow functions to solve these problems if possible.

In addition to the prompts available at the top of each file, Mocha specs are
provided to test your work.

To get started, use the following commands:

```shell
cd <path to project directory>
npm install
npm test
```
