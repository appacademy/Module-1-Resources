# Scope Project - Part 3

In this project, you will be using your knowledge of scope to solve programming
problems.

In this part, you will be tackling the next 5 problems:

- `12-volume`
- `13-dynamic-divide`
- `14-smoothie-machine`
- `15-closure-dynamic-multi`
- `16-coupon`

Make sure to write your solutions using arrow function notation. Try to take
advantage of the properties of arrow functions and/or closures to solve these
problems if possible.

Don't forget to run the Mocha to test your solutions.
