# Scope Project - Part 4

In this project, you will be using your knowledge of scope to solve programming
problems.

In this part, you will be tackling the last 4 problems:

- `17-arrow-reverse`
- `18-planned-intersection`
- `19-coin-collector`
- `20-curried-sum`

Make sure to write your solutions using arrow function notation. Try to take
advantage of the properties of arrow functions and/or closures to solve these
problems if possible.

Don't forget to run the Mocha to test your solutions.
