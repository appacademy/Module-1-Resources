# Advanced Array Project

It's time to get some practice using Node.js and the advanced Array methods!
Included are a number of array-related problems.

Complete the problems in the order specified. You must use the Array methods
that you've learned.

You will need to pass all the tests in order to move on.

To run the tests for the above problems you will need to unzip the file you
downloaded.

To get started, use the following commands:

1. `cd` into the project directory
2. `npm install` to install any dependencies
3. `npm test` to run the test cases

The `npm test` command will run all the tests. If you have any trouble with this
don't hesitate to ask a TA for help!

To test only one of the test files at a time, you can run the command,
`npm test test/<test file name>` (e.g. `npm test test/00-sum-forEach.js`),
where `test` is the name of the test folder. You must run this command one
directory above the `test` directory.

P.S. You may notice the `package.json`/`package-lock.json` files and
`node_modules` directory. You do not need to edit any of those contents. Those
files are what we use to package the project and create the test cases.
