# Callbacks Project - Part 4

In this project, you will continue using your knowledge of callbacks to solve
programming problems.

In this part, you will be tackling the last 6 problems:

- `19-greater-callback-value`
- `20-none`
- `21-at-most`
- `22-first-index`
- `23-alternating-map`
- `24-my-simple-reduce`

These will be the most challenging yet! Don't forget to carefully plan out
your approach to the problem before starting your solution. If you finish early,
take some time to try to refine your answers or solve them another way. Be
prepared to discuss your solutions.

Don't forget to run the Mocha to test your solutions.
