# Callbacks Project - Part 3

In this project, you will continue using your knowledge of callbacks to solve
programming problems.

In this part, you will be tackling the next 6 problems:

- `13-min-value-callback`
- `14-map-mutator`
- `15-sentence-mapper`
- `16-suffix-cipher`
- `17-xor-select`
- `18-one`

These problems will involve you writing a function that takes a callback
function. Think through the process carefully before starting your solution.
If you finish early, take some time to try to refine your answers or solve them
another way. Be prepared to discuss your solutions.

Don't forget to run the Mocha to test your solutions.
