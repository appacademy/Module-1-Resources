# Object Problems

It's time to get some practice using Objects! Below we've included a link to
download a `zip` file for a number of problems.

Complete the problems in the order specified.

To run the tests for the above problems you will need to unzip the file you
downloaded and then navigate into the directory for that file. Once there you
can run the following two commands:

```sh
~ npm install
~ npm test
```

The `npm install` commands will install all the testing dependencies.

The `npm test` command will run all the tests. If you have any trouble with this
don't hesitate to ask a TA for help!

When you finish your project, don't forget to add your project to your Github!

  1. Go to [Github][github]
  2. Create a new repo
  3. Initialize the local directory as a Git repository
  4. Save your finished project
  5. Add and commit your project
  6. Push the project to the repo you created
