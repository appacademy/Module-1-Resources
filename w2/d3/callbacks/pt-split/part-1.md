# Callbacks Project - Part 1

In this project, you will be using your knowledge of callbacks to solve
programming problems.

In this part, you will be tackling the first 6 problems:

- `01-my-for-each`
- `02-my-map`
- `03-multi-map`
- `04-my-filter`
- `05-selective-map`
- `06-reject`

These problems will involve you writing a function that takes a callback
function. Think through the process carefully before starting your solution.
Use Polya's Problem-Solving Framework and write down your notes as
comments in the file before you type a single line of code.

If you finish early, take some time to try to refine your answers or solve them
another way. Be prepared to discuss your solutions.

In addition to the prompts available at the top of each file, Mocha specs are
provided to test your work.

To get started, use the following commands:

```shell
cd <path to project directory>
npm install
npm test
```
