  Callbacks!

  We previously learned that functions are first class objects!
    Three reason why!
      * 1. Be stored in a variable:
        ** Function Expression
      * 2. Passed as an argument to a function:
        ** Callback Functions
      * 3. Returned from a function:
        ** Closures/Recursion

  What is a callback function?
    * A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument
    * Which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action

  What is a higher order function?
    * Function that receives or returns a function

  When passing a anonymous callback function, use a arrow function
    * Much cleaner and shorter
    [1,2,3].map(num => num * 10);// [10,20,30];
    * vs
    [1,2,3].map(function(num){
      return num * 10;
    });
    * Its also MDN's recommended way

  Callback vs Helper functions
  * All callbacks are helper functions
  * But not all helper functions are callbacks
    * Callbacks must be explicitly passed as an argument to a function
