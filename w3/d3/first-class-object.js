But what does this all mean? This brings us around to the concept of first
class objects. A first class object is defined as:
* 1. It can be stored in a variable
  - function expression
* 2. it can be passed as an argument to a function (coming up next week!)
  - callback
* 3. It can be returned from a function (also coming up next week!)
  - closure/recursion
