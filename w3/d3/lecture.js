  Call stack!
  - The call stack is a structure that js uses to keep track of evaluation of function calls
  - stack data structure
  - first in last out, ex: stack of plates
  - add to stack, youre pushing to the top
  - if you remove from the stack, you are popping off!

  Notes about the call stack
  - when a function is called, it is pushed to the top of the call stack
  - when a function is returned, it is popped of the call stack(if there is no return, function return will default to undefined)
  - function that is at the top of the call stack, is the function currently being executed
  * functions evaluate to there return
