# Timeout Project

Time to practice dealing with asynchronous functions like `setTimeout` and
`setInterval`. Your objective is to implement the functions in each file
of the `/problems` directory. In addition to the prompts available at the
top of each file, test specs are provided to test your work.

To get started, use the following commands:

1. `cd` into the project directory
2. `npm install` to install any dependencies
3. `npm test` to run the test cases

**Important Note:**
It is very helpful to run each node file with `console.log`s to observe the
behavior of your code and help with debugging. However, **you MUST comment out
any local test cases** that you add to the problem files before running the
tests, because additional logs may cause the tests to fail.
