  Call Stack!
    * The call stack is a structure that js uses to keep track of evaluation of function calls
    * function is at the top stack, it is the function currently being executed
    * stack data structure
      * EX: Stack of plates
    * first in last out
    * when a function is called, it is pushed on the call stack
    * when a function is returned, it is popped off the call stack
