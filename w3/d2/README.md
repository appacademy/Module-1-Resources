### Call stack - [FIGMA]

`Video Lectures`

- [Call Stack Lecture]
  - [Video Code](./code-it-out/call_stack.js)

`Discussion`

- Is JS single-threaded or multi-threaded?
  - What does this mean?
- What is a 'stack'?
- Looking at the code from the video (with replaced debuggers) can\
you walk me through what's happening to the call stack?

### Recursion

`Video Lectures`

- [The Recursive Call Stack]
- [A Case Study]

`Discussion`

- What is a recursive function?
- What are the 'parts' of a recursive function?
- EXAMPLES
  - [countdown](./code-it-out/countdown.js)
    - Can you label the recursive 'parts'?
    - Can you walk me through what's happening in the call stack?
  - [rec_sum](./code-it-out/rec_sum.js)
    - Can you label the recursive 'parts'?
    - Can you walk me through what's happening in the call stack?
  - [reverse_rec](./code-it-out/reverse_rec.js)
    - Can you label the recursive 'parts'?
    - Can you walk me through what's happening in the call stack?
