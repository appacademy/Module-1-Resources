  Intro to JavaScript

  What is Javascript?
    * JavaScript is a programming language that was originally developed to increase user interactivity with websites, and has grown to become a useful programming language in the backend of applications as well. JavaScript is now one of the most popular and widely used programming languages for building web applications today.

  Why is javascript so useful?
    * Perform asynchronous task
    * Render dynamic content
    * Enables more responsive, performant websites
    * Integrates seamlessly with two core languages of web development, HTML and CSS

   * We want to learn JavaScript!

  What is learning?
    * 1. Learning new skills and being able to apply them in the future
    * 2. Retaining useful information

  Active vs Passive Learning
    * Active learning  - lets you engage, get hands on!
    * Passive learning -  watching not applying

  We will be doing both!

  * Passive followed by active learning!
  * Lecture followed by self practice

  Desirable difficulty
    * it's challenging, but not discouraging
    * Possible given proper skill level
    * Hard but not too hard
    * But also not easy
    * Find a Happy Medium

  Spaced Repetition
    * Repeating concepts with time between
    * Rest your brain
    * Pomodoro Method

  What is debugging?
    * Figuring out what is wrong with the code
    * Identifying and solving an error

  How do we debug?
    * console.log() - show them on mdn
    * if you want to see something on the screen use a console.log
    * debugger
    * go line by line
    * developer tools
    * error messages
    * trial and error

  How to style/format?
    * Style Guide

  Whats the deal with semicolons?
    * JS Automatic semicolon insertion
    * semicolons Js doesn't strictly need semi colons because its smart, it uses something called automatic semicolon insertion, But it is best practice to use them for finishing statements
    * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#automatic_semicolon_insertion


  * Comments
  Why do we use comments?
    * explain what your code is doing
    * creating a plan using polya's framework!
    * notes

  * Console.logs
  When do we use a console.log?
    * When we want to see something in the terminal

// comments - single line comment

comment

*/


// console.logs
// we use to see something in terminal
// console.log('hello world');

let string = 'hello world';
let sentence = 'a really long sentence'
console.log('a really long sentence')
console.log('a really long sentence')
console.log('a really long sentence')
// use variables to save typing
console.log(string);
console.log(string);
console.log(string);
