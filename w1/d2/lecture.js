  What is JavaScript?
  - JavaScript is a programming language that was originally developed
   to increase user interactivity with websites, and has grown to become a
   useful programming language in the backend of applications as well.
   JavaScript is now one of the most popular and widely used programming
   languages for building web applications today.

  - Languages used for developing web pages
  - Also javascript for backend as well using node.
  - multi-paradigm

  Why is javascript is so useful?
  - render dynamic content
  - perform asynchronous task!

  We want to learn javascript!

  What is learning?
  - gaining new knowledge and using it later down the line
  - Taking in info and being able to apply it
  - memorizing content and applying that knowledge

  Active learning vs Passive learning

  - Active learning - hands on practice, engaging with the info
      ex: sports - on the field running the drills

  - Passive learning - passive is just listening, watching lecture, videos, reading content
      ex: sports - watching football, watching the practice, studying the plays

  Intro to JavaScript!

  What is debugging?
  - fixing an error
  - troubleshooting errors
  - correcting the code
  - error messages
  - console.log!
  - dev tools
  - breakpoints debugger
  - node

// console.log!
// We use console.logs whenever we want to see something on the screen
// console.log('welcome to App Academy :)');
// use console.log like crazy!

//preview on numbers
// console.log(21 + 78);//99
// inside the console.log were saying evaluate the expression inside then print it the terminal

let name = "brandon";

// console.log('name:', name);//console.log can take an many arguments
//hey i want to log to the terminal whatever the name variable evaluates too

  Numbers and Booleans

  Numbers!
  1. negative
  2. decimals
  3. integer
  4. whole numbers
  5. few other cases

  What is PEMDAS! - parentheses, exponents, multiplication, modulo, division, addition, subtraction

  Order of operations - Please excuse my dear mother aunt sally

*/

// console.log(2 + 3 * 12); //38
// console.log(10 - 8 / 2); //6
// console.log(20 / 2); //10
// console.log(1.11 * 4); //4.44
// console.log((3 + 9) / 3); //4
// console.log(4 + 3 * (3 * 2)); //22



// Modulo
// // returns a remainder
// console.log('====>',13 % 5);// 3
// // hey divide 5 into 13 twice and return the remainder which is 3
// console.log(3 % 7);// 3
// // 3 cant divide by 7, so we return 3


// console.log(12 % 5);// 2
// console.log(25 % 6);// 1
// console.log(5 % 18);// 5
// console.log(12 % 3);// 0

// Modulo can be useful when you need a number is even
// we can check by doing if(n % 2 === 0) its an even number


/*

  Booleans!

  Logical operators
  ! - not(bang)
  && - and
  || - or

  Order of operations
  not and or
   |, &&, ||

  return a boolean - true or false

//what will code evaluate too?
// console.log(false);

//can we store a boolean in a variable
let a = true;
let b = false;

/*

  Variables!
  - like storing a value in a box
  - is pointing a variable at a data type in memory
  - variables evaluates to the value that they are pointing at in memory

  Value could be
    - string
    - number
    - boolean
    - function
    - and more!

/*

Variable initialization - both declaring and assignment
Variable declaration -  declaring the variable
Variable assignment - assignment of a value to a variable

*/


let variableName;// variable declaration
variableName = 'hello';// variable assignment

//variable initialization
//were saying hey, store in the variable names variableName2 the string 'hello 2' using the keyword let
//let keyword, name of variable, followed be the = - assignment operator, followed by the value to save
// the = sign essentially saves the variable in memory
let variableName2 = 'hello 2';

//we can store many data types
let firstName = 'brandon';
let age = 27;
let isSoftwareEngineer = true;

// console.log(firstName); //brandon
// console.log(age); //27
// console.log(isSoftwareEngineer); //true

//we can change the types of our variables
age = '27';
// console.log(age)

// reassignment
// we used the assignment operator - = to reassign age
// were gonna reassign age back to a number
age = 27;// no let keyword - reassign if variable already exists, if it doesn't then it will declare the variable globally
// console.log(age)


let num = 0;
console.log(num);//0
num++;
console.log(num);//1
//num++ is shorthand for
num += 1;
console.log(num);//2
//num += 1 is shorthand for
num = num + 1;
console.log(num);//3
num + 1
console.log(num);//3 because we did not save with the assignment operator - =

console.log(num + 'hey');// 3hey
//it is concatenated! because + sign doubles as a way to concatenation strings
// when using the + sign it will typecase(change the data type) the number into a string and combine with hey
// 3 => '3' + 'hey'

// KNOW ARE DATATYPES!
let number = 1;
// console.log('look here', typeof number)//number
// console.log(typeof 'example')//string


// add birthday of string
// 10-15-1995
