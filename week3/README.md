# Week 3 Additional Resources

## Learning Objectives

* Recursion
  * Given a recursive function, identify what is the base case and the recursive case.
  * Identify and use default parameters for functions.
  * Define what a "stack overflow" means in JavaScript's call stack.
  * Identify what causes the error `RangeError: Maximum call stack`.
  * Map out the recursive call stack when running a test case through a recursion function.
  * Solve problems using recursion.
  * Given a buggy recursive function, debug the function.
* Asynchronicity
  * Identify JavaScript as a language that utilizes an event loop model.
  * Identify JavaScript as a single threaded language.
  * Describe the difference between asynchronous and synchronous code.
  * Execute the asynchronous function `setTimeout` with a callback.
  * Use `setInterval` to have a function execute 10 times with a 1 second period. After the 10th cycle, clear the interval.
  * Write a program that accepts user input using Node’s readline module (only for working on Guessing Game Project).
